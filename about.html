    <p class="lab">Describing food is not as easy as it would seem.
      How many ways can you say something was really tasty? 
      Not enough to keep you interested in what you are writing.
      That is why we have to borrow words from other areas to describe the food and the effect it has on us.
      You can compare a dish to a picture, a sports game, a musical performance or give it personality.
      Describe its sunny or somber mood, shyness, assertiveness, or contradiction of flavors. 
      Knowing the words for describing tastes and flavors will help you to find the right adjective in other areas.
